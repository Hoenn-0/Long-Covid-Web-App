            <h1> About Long Covid </h1>
            <p>
                Long Covid is the long lasting symptoms of COVID-19 that effects at least 20% of covid patients.This is studied to be the case even for young,
                healthy adults aged 18-34. Emerging evidence and patient testimonies shows that the number of people who experience COVID-19 cannot seem to get
                rid of their symptoms. Long term effects of covid can be debilitating, even for young fit people or those who
                were lucky enough not to go to hospital when they had COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many people tend to feel better in a few days or weeks and most make a full recover within 12 
                week. But for some people , symptoms can last longer. The exact number of people suffering from long covid
                is unknown however it is estimated that 60,000 people are said to suffer from long covid but this figure may be
                higher. Symptoms vary and still being understood, but inlcude confusion, chronic fatigue, Lasting organ damage, Post-intensive care syndrome,
                loss of taste and smell as well as breathlessness.
